# ACE3-AB-Zeroer

Arma 3 ACE3 tool

Provides some tools for tweaking your Arma 3 ACE3 AtragMX profiles, such as
- GUI to fully control the atmospheric variables (temperature, barometric pressure, relative air humidity, wind strength and direction in degrees)
- Function to calculate the optimal truing drop parameters when setting a custom drag coefficient table
  - I may make a video of this at some point but such isn't in the works.

This mission is on GitHub mainly for the functions somebody may find interesting. As for now, most of them aren't included in my other Arma 3 Git Repos.
